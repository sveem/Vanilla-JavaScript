# Group People
Write a JavaScript function groupBy('criteria') that groups an array of people by age, first or last name. Create a
Person constructor to add every person in the person array. The groupBy('criteria') function must return an object,
with keys – the groups (age, firstName and lastName) and values – arrays with people in this group. Print on the
console every entry of the returned object. Use function overloading (i.e. just one function).
