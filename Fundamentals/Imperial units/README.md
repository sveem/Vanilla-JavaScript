# Imperial Units
Imperial units are confusing, but still in use in some backwards countries (Myanmar, Liberia and the United States
are the only countries still using them). They are so confusing in fact, that native users struggle to convert between
them. Write a JS function that converts from inches to feet and inches. 
There are 12 inches in a foot. See the example for formatting details.
The input comes as an array of one string element that needs to be parsed as a number.
The output should be printed to the console.
