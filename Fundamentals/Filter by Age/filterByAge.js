/*
 * Write a JS function that stores the name and age of two persons in objects and then filters them by minimum age.
 * The input comes as array of string elements. The first element is the minimum age. 
 * The second and third elements are the name and age of the first person and the fourth and fifth elements â€“ the name and age of the second person. 
 * The three age parameters need to be parsed as numbers.
 * The output should be printed to the console.
