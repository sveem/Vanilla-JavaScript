/*
 * Write a JavaScript function sortLetters(string, boolean) that gets as an input a string and a boolean. The function
 * sorts all letters in the string in alphabetical order and returns the newly formed string. The sorting is ascending if
 * the boolean is true otherwise the sorting is in descending order.
 * Note: The sorting is case-insensitive but the output should use the same casing as the input!
 * Hint: You are allowed to use .sort() function.
