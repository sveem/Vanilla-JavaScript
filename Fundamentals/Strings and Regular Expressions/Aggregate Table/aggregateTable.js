/*
 * You will be given a list of towns and incomes for each town, formatted in a table, separated by pipes (|). 
 * Write a JS function that extracts the names of all towns and produces a sum of the incomes. 
 * Note that splitting may result in empty string elements and the number of spaces may be different in every table.
 * The input comes as array of string elements. Each element is one row in a formatted table.
 * The output is printed on the console on two lines. On the first line, print a comma-separated list of all towns and on
 * the second, the sum of all incomes.
