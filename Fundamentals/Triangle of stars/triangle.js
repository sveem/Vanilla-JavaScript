/*
 * Write a JS function that outputs a triangle made of stars with variable size, depending on an input parameter. 
 * Look at the examples to get an idea.
 * The input comes as an array with one string element in it, which needs to be parsed to a number.
 * The output is a series of lines printed on the console, forming a triangle of variable size.
