/*
 * Write a JS function that extracts only those numbers that form a non-decreasing subsequence. In other words, you
 * start from the first element and continue to the end of the given array of numbers. Any number which is LESS
 * THAN the current biggest one is ignored, alternatively if itâ€™s equal or higher than the current biggest one you set it
 * as the current biggest one and you continue to the next number.
 * The input comes as array of strings. Each element will represent a number.
 * The output is the processed array after the filtration, which should be a non-decreasing subsequence. 
 * Each element should be printed on a new line.
