/*
 * Land surveyors use grads (also known as gon, 400 grads in a full turn) in their documents. Grads are rather unwieldy
 * though, so you need to write a JS function that converts from grads to degrees. 
 * In addition, your program needs to constrain the results within the range , so if you arrive at a value like -15째, it needs to be converted to 345째 and 420째
 * becomes 60째.
 * The input comes as an array of one string element that needs to be parsed as a number.
 * The output should be printed to the console.
