/*
 * JSONâ€™s Table is a magical table which turns JSON data into an HTML table. You will be given JSON strings holding
 * data about employees, including their name, position and salary. You need to parse that data into objects, and
 * create an HTML table which holds the data for each employee on a different row, as columns.
 *
 * The name and position of the employee are strings, the salary is a number.
 *
 * The input comes as array of strings. Each element is a JSON string which represents the data for a certain employee.
 *
 * The output is the HTML code of a table which holds the data exactly as explained above. Check the examples for
 * more info.
