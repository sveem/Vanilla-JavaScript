/*
 * You have been tasked to follow the sales of products in the different towns. For every town you need to keep track
 * of all the products sold, and for every product, the amount of total income.
 *
 * The input comes as array of strings. Each element will represent data about a product and its sales. The format of
 * input is:
 * {town} -> {product} -> {amountOfSales} : {priceForOneUnit}
 *
 * The town and product are both strings. The amount of sales and price for one unit will be numbers. Store all towns,
 * for every town, store its products, and for every product, its amount of total income. The total income is calculated
 * with the following formula - amount of sales * price for one unit. If you receive as input a town you already have,
 * you should just add the new product to it.
 *
 * As output you must print every town, its products and their total income.
 * The order of output for each of those entries is â€“ by order of entrance.
