/*
 * Youâ€™re tasked with calculating the total sum of income for a number of Towns. You will receive an array of strings
 * representing towns and their incomes, every even index will be a town and every odd index will be an income
 * belonging to that town. Create an object that will hold all the towns as keys and their total income (the sum of their
 * incomes) as values to those keys and print it as a JSON.
 * The input comes as an array of strings - each even index is the name of a town and each odd index is an income
 * belonging to that town.
 * The output should be printed on the console - JSON representation of the object containing all towns and their total
 * incomes.
