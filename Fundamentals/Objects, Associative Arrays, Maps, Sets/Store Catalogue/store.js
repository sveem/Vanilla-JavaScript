/*
 * You have to create a sorted catalogue of store products. You will be given the products’ names and prices. You need
 * to order them by alphabetical order.
 *
 * The input comes as array of strings. Each element holds info about a product in the following format:
 * “{productName} : {productPrice}”
 *
 * The product’s name will be a string, which will always start with a capital letter, and the price will be a number.
 * You can safely assume there will be NO duplicate product input. The comparison for alphabetical order is case-
 * insensitive.
 *
 * As output you must print all the products in a specified format. They must be ordered exactly as specified above.
 * The products must be divided into groups, by the initial of their name. The group’s initial should be printed, and
 * after that the products should be printed with 2 spaces before their names.
