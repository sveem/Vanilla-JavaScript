/*
 * Write a JS function that calculates the distance between the two points in 3D by given coordinates.
 * The input comes as an array of strings that need to be parsed as numbers. The first three elements are the x, y and z
 * coordinates for the first point and the second set of arguments are the coordinates of the other point.
 * The output should be printed to the console.
 * Hint:You can find the horizontal and vertical offset between two points by calculating the difference between their
 * respective coordinates. Use Pythagorasâ€™ theorem to find the distance.
