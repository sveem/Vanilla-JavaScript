# Reveal Triangles
You are given a sequence of text lines, holding small Latin letters. Your task is to reveal all triangles in the text by
changing their letters with "*". Triangles consist of equal letters in the form of triangle.
Triangles can span different sizes: 2 lines, 3 lines, 4 lines, etc. Triangles can overlap (some letters can take part in
several triangles).
