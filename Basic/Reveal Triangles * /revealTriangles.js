/*
 * You are given a sequence of text lines, holding small Latin letters. Your task is to reveal all triangles in the text by
 * changing their letters "*". Triangles consist of equal letters in the form of triangle:
 * Triangles can span different sizes: 2 lines, 3 lines, 4 lines, etc. Triangles can overlap (some letters can take part in
 * several triangles).
 *
 * Input
 * The input data comes as array of strings, holding the text lines.
 *
 * Output
 * Print at the console the input data after replacing all triangles by &#39;*&#39;.
 *
 * Constraints
 * -The input will be passed to the first JavaScript function found in your code as array of strings.
 * -Each input line will hold 1â€¦100 Latin letters.
 * -The number of input lines will be in the range [1..100].
 * -Allowed working time: 0.2 seconds. Allowed memory: 16 MB.
 *
 * Hint: to simplify your work, you can reveal only triangles of size &quot;2 lines&quot;, because all bigger triangles consist of
 * several overlapping triangles of size &quot;2 lines&quot;.
