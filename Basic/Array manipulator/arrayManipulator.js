/*
 * You are given an array of objects. Your task is to write a JavaScript code that filters out the numbers of that array
 * (removes all non-number objects). Then you should: 
 * 1. Find the Min number, 
 * 2. Find the Max number, 
 * 3. Find the most frequent number. 
 * Finally you should print out the numbers you have found and the filtered array sorted in
 * descending order.
